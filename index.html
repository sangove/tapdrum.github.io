<div class="cont-3"><p class="para-4"><span class="font-7">Russell Lynn is a young adult who suffers from Lowes Syndrome. Lowes Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects less than 150 people world wide, but is very debilitating. Lowes syndrome affects the kidneys, eyes, as well as growth and mental development. Though Russel continues to develop physically, he has the mental maturity of someone much younger. His lower mental age and visual impairment make it difficult for Russell to interact with traditional learning materials. He loves music and it has been imperative in his therapy and through out the progression of his disorder. </span></p><p class="para-4"><span class="font-7"> </span></p><p class="para-4"><span class="font-7">While speaking with Tracie Lynn, Russell’s mom, she informed me that Russell feels a lack of control in his life and learning. He is wheelchair bound, and is blind, so he cannot navigate by himself, read or perform certain tasks that we take for granted. He also is unable to control content he listens to, so audio books and music are put on, and he has no control over the speed they are played, or if they are played at all, until now.</span></p><p class="para-4"><span class="font-7"> </span></p><p class="para-4"><span class="font-7">If you have watched the video above, you will notice that Russell loves to drum. He is always patting away on his leg or anything he can get his hands on, because he loves music. The idea behind making it a drum, was that it would allow Russell to use a familiar motion to control music himself. Through pre-programmed instruments, and simple voice commands, Russell can play instruments that he would never have the dexterity to, by simply drumming. The drumming would also extend to Russell controlling the speed of existing songs, audio books and other learning materials as well. The whole idea being that through on of his favourite things to do, drum, we are restoring some of his control in his own life.</span></p></div>
